Homework 4: In this programming assignment you are asked to develop a vision system that recovers the
 orientation and reflectance of an objects surface. For this purpose you will use photometric
 stereo. You will be given 3 images of an object taken using three different light sources. Your
 task is to compute the surface normals and albedo for this object. For this purpose, however,
 you will need to know the directions and intensities of the 3 light sources. Thus, in the first
 part of the assignment, you will compute the light sources directions and intensities from 4
 images of a sphere and use this information in the second part to recover the orientation and
 reflectance. The 7 greyscale images, sphere0.pgm ... sphere3.pgm and object1.pgm ...
 object3.pgm, can be found on Piazza. Your program will be tested also with additional test
 images we have taken.

First you need to find the location of the sphere and its radius. For this purpose
you will use the image sphere0, which is taken using many light sources (so that the
 entire front hemisphere is visible).
